# Challenge ðŸ“–

We want to implement an API to manage all events and plans.
For that we want use 
 - Kotlin
 - Spring Boot
 
It's very important for that check how are you testing your code to assure the best quality possible.

To manage this events, we need to create the following endpoints:

- Create event with:
  - ID
  - Title
  - Description
  - Image
  - Date
  - Location with Latitude/Longitude
  
- Update event by ID
- Delete event by ID
- Get all events
- Get event by ID

The project will be deployed using Docker, so you need to create a Dockerfile and generate an image.

âœ¨ We will evaluate:
- Test coverage 
- Testing decisions
- How do you split your code
- Use CLEAN Architecture
- Good understandable code
